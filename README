TODO:

  - reformat this file using markdown
  - replace consolelog with twisted log
  - Announce when registered clients connect/disconnect
  - Perform an action when number of connected registered clients goes to zero or nonzero
  - image screensaver
    - turn screen on during motion
  - find a better way to manage deps; relying on apt for libs is suboptimal
